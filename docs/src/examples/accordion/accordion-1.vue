          The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small
          space through progressive disclosure. The user gets key details about
          the underlying content and can choose to expand that content within
          the constraints of the accordion. Accordions work especially well on
          mobile interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a premium.
